# Parkinsons-Prediction-Model

A. Model Overview
1. Task: Classifies patients as having Parkinson's disease or not.
2. Data: Trained on a dataset of 31 people, some with Parkinson's disease and some without.
3. Features: Utilizes various features like vocal frequency and tremor.
4. Accuracy: Achieves 88% accuracy on both training and testing data.

B. Potential Applications
1. Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
2. Improved patient monitoring and treatment planning.
3. Aiding medical professionals in diagnosis.


C. Important Note:
This model is not a perfect diagnostic tool, and a doctor's consultation is always recommended.
